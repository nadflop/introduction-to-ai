'Design your own Sokoban levels here.
'Include a brief explanation to each level why the algorithmic improvement
'  that is targeted makes a big difference on this level

'Level improving from ucs to ucs -d
'This level has a lot of corner and edge deadlock which is possible
'for the box to reach it so doing a dead point detection
'cuts down a lot of states which is a big algorithmic improvement

'Level improving from ucs -d to f -d
'Action compression reduces the number of states by checking if 
'a position is reachable by the player, where ucs doesn't.
'This level has certain states where the boxes aren't in dead points but 
'then they are unreachable by the player
